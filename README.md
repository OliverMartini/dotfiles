Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

As I was working on the dotfiles for Windows I thought; hey why not follow [Jessica Deen's](https://github.com/jldeen) approach and have dotfiles for different environments in the same repo.

So here they are:
  - [dotfiles/wsl](https://github.com/OliverMartini/dotfiles/tree/wsl)
  - [dotfiles/windows](https://github.com/OliverMartini/dotfiles/tree/windows)

## Thanks
I sourced the concepts for my dotfiles from multiple places. Noteworthy are the following:
  - [Jessica Deen's](https://github.com/jldeen) - [dotfiles/wsl](https://github.com/jldeen/dotfiles/tree/wsl)
  - [Zach Holman's](https://github.com/holman) - [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
  - [Jay Harris's](https://github.com/jayharris) - [dotfiles-windows](https://github.com/jayharris/dotfiles-windows)
